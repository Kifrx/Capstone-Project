            "The customer's main complaint revolves around the toy's design and functionality. The dog genius struggles to figure out the puzzle, and even when filled, it's difficult for her to retrieve treats due to the design. The pull rope sinks to the bottom, making it hard to retrieve, especially for a smaller dog. Additionally, the toy doesn't accommodate multiple dogs playing together, as the pull rope becomes ineffective when both dogs try to engage with it. The medium chewer also destroyed the rubber pull rope, indicating a durability issue. Therefore, the primary category of complaint is Desain & Fungsi (Design & Functionality).\n",
